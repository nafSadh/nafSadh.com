          Born and raised in Bangladesh, trained in computer science at KUET and 
          Stony Brook, I work as a software engineer for Google and live with my 
          lovely wife Sampreeti in Mountain View.

          I have explored wide range of development stacks including systems, 
          applications, data and web technologies. I dream of building a knowledge 
          system that can learn and reason. My other interests include intelligent 
          systems, logic, linguistics, and epistemology.

          In the past I have built cool stuff at TCI and Samsung. Besides, I am 
          involved with several other projects. Some of their sources are on 
          GitHub.

          I post weblogs on inside the insight. I share my Bengali writings on 
          Sadhubôchôn and Sulol Songroho. I am also involved as editor and 
          publisher at Bengali literary community Lekhalikhi. I love to play with 
          colors, draw pictures and make graphic artworks; you can browse them on 
          my arts portfolio. I use a Bengali keyboard lay-out named Sonnivo which 
          happened to be designed by me.
