              Hello!
            <p/>
            <p>
              I am Sadh. Okay, my full given name is Khan Muhammad Nafee Mostafa Sadh – pretty long, huh?
              May be, and yes, because of it, I end up being called by different names: Khan,
              Sadh or even Nafee. I prefer to be addressed as Sadh or Khan.
            <p/>
            <p>
              In a nice dawn on October 10, I screamed for the first time and the world said me
              welcome with a beaming soft sunlight amidst the quiet of the nice town of Tangail.
              Soon I became the source of smile for my mom Nasrin A. and dad G. Mostafa Khan. I
              started to play a lot, draw pictures, watch cartoons, read stories and soon at the
              age of 3 years found myself accompanied by a sweet little sister Shuchi.
            <p/>
            <p>
              I got my first schooling at “Town Government Primary School, Tangail”;
              in those days, I used to rush on the streets all over my neighborhood riding my
              favorite bicycle and played cricket. As days passed, I started going to “BinduBasini
              Govt. Boys’ High School”, which has earned fame across the state by teaching students
              from 1880 A.D. I feel proud of this school and met the most amazing group of friends
              there.
            <p/>
            <p>
              In the year of 2003, I appeared in my first public examination from BinduBasini
              and completed secondary school education. Afterwards, I moved to Dhaka and went
              to B&nbsp;N&nbsp;M Rifles Public School and College. There, I met few nice fellows;
              I also met friends from other colleges of the city and eventually completed my
              higher secondary education in 2005.
            <p/>
            <p>
              In the following year, I decided to pursue an engineering degree majoring in
              Computer Science and went to Khulna University of Engineering & Technology (KUET).
              At KUET I studied several aspects of computing technology and completed
              several successful student projects. I worked on ‘intelligent&nbsp;home’
              with Ratul, Srijon and Rizel under supervision of Prof. MMA Hashem
              and developed the INTELOME (showcased in BASIS&nbsp;SofExpo&nbsp;2008). Later,
              with Ratul we worked on ‘automated traffic jam recognition using image
              processing’. This project was named ‘Traffic Window’ and been supervised
              by Rushdi Shams. Next, I along with Parvej, Ratul and Sourav formed the
              PSSR Web Engineers group and worked on a project codenamed ‘SeaLand’.
              This project targeted at developing a community web service that benefit
              both professional and personal aspects of life. My undergraduate thesis
              was on Semantic Web co-authored with Ratul and Sourav and supervised by
              Rushdi Shams. We suggested a framework called RS2 (stands for
              ‘RDF by Structured Reference to Semantics’) that will process the
              web documents and produce machine readable format in RDF collaborated
              with the OWL (Web Ontology Language). It will help in fulfilling the
              dream to introduce next generation web, Web 3.0 of the Giant Global Graph.
              I enjoyed problem solving with the aid of computer programming. I was
              lucky to attend an ACM ICPC Dhaka Regional Contest event in 2007 and
              secured the 11th place.
            <p/>
            <p>
              I really had four wonderful years at KUET, most colorful and certainly
              most memorable four years of my life. I resided in Fazlul Haque Hall
              and passed a lot of time hanging out with my friends. They included a
              lot of wonderful people from whom I learned a lot, about life and world.
              I also have been active in several important roles around the campus.
              I have served as general secretary of Fazlul Haque Hall’s Hall Committee
              and the Class Representative of KUET CSE 2k5. I was the General Secretary
              of IEEE Student Branch at KUET.
            <p/>
            <p>
              After graduating from KUET in 2010, I came back to Dhaka. Right then,
              Samsung was forming its R&D hub at Dhaka and I joined with them. It was
              a new and different experience, with a small group of different people.
              But, soon, the company started to grow and it managed to hire about
              six hundred engineers in following three years. Indeed more than just
              a few of my friends from KUET also joined there. A corporate workplace
              might not be always perceived as a fun place; but many amazing people
              worked there and yes, we had good times beside the work chores. In
              three years I made friends, and most luckily met my wonderful fiancé,
              Sampreeti.
            <p/>
            <p>
              I had my undergraduate degrees, and I was thinking about having a
              Master’s degree. So, I applied for some programs in 2013 and enrolled
              in MS in Computer Science program at Stony Brook University, NY.
              In Fall last year, I flew to America and started to live in Long Island.
              The town I lived in is really beautiful one and the school is a true
              cosmopolitan hub of education.
            </p>
            <p>
              In winter or 2014-15, I <a href='http://http://its-our-wedding.com/'>married</a>
              my then fiancé, Sampreeti, with whom I live in the village of Mineola. Besides
              trying to be a husband and watching YouTube, I also work as a Software Engineer
              for a software company in Islandia, NY.
