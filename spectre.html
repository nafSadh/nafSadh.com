    <p>
      I study theory and applications of computing sciences and work as software engineer for TCI. I received my master's degree from Stony Brook University in 2014 and engineering degree from KUET in 2010. In past I worked for Samsung and SUNY RF. To know more, have a look at my résumé.

      In winter of 2014-15  Sampreeti and I got married. My lovely wife works as software engineer and is now attending NYU Poly for an MS in EE.

      I have been involved with several projects . Some of their sources are in GitHub . I have explored wide range of development stacks including systems, applications, data and web technologies. I am fond of C++, but I use several other languages extensively. I dream of building a knowledge system that can learn and reason. My other interests include intelligent systems, logic, linguistics, and epistemology.

      I post weblogs on inside the insight. Some of my presentations are shared on SlideShare. I share my Bengali writings on Sadhubôchôn and Sulol Songroho. I am also involved with Bengali literary community Lekhalikhi. I love to play with colors, draw pictures and make graphic artworks; you can browse them on my artsportfolio. I use a Bengali keyboard lay-out named Sonnivo which happened to be designed by me.

      Keep in touch with me on  @nafSadh and keep exploring.
